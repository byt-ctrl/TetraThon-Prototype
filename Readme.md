> **ArgiTech** is an integrated dual-engine decision-support platform engineered to empower smallholder farmers with stage-aware, weather-responsive crop advisories and algorithmic post-harvest loss minimization strategies.

---

## Project Overview

India's 85%+ smallholder farming ecosystem experiences severe income leakage due to two distinct, unaddressed vulnerabilities:

1. **In-Season Yield Penalties (20–30% Yield Loss)**  
   Conventional agricultural extension services provide static, generic advice. Farmers lack stage-specific recommendations that adapt dynamically to 7-day local weather forecasts, resulting in sub-optimal irrigation timing, fertilizer waste, and delayed pest management.

2. **Post-Harvest Financial Loss (15–25% Produce Waste)**  
   After harvest, farmers struggle to make optimal financial decisions regarding whether to **Sell Immediately**, **Store Produce** to wait for price rebounds, or **Transport to Regional Markets** offering higher prices. Without quantitative models evaluating spoilage decay curves against transport costs, farmers incur significant net value loss.

**ArgiTech** unifies both solutions into a single, high-performance web application powered by a **Stage-Aware Crop Advisory Engine** and an **Algorithmic Post-Harvest Decision Engine**.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Stage-Aware Precision Crop Advisory Engine (Module A)
* **Growth Stage Computation**: Automatically determines crop growth stage based on sowing date and crop duration metadata.
* **Multi-Factor Rule Engine**: Evaluates JSON agronomic matrices for Irrigation, NPK Fertilization, and Pest/Disease risks alongside 7-day weather outlooks.
* **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns High, Medium, or Low confidence ratings to recommendations based on rule-matching precision.
* **Actionable Advice**: Generates plain-language, field-ready instructions (e.g. precise irrigation depth, dosage per acre, disease warnings).

### 2. Post-Harvest Loss & Logistics Planner (Module B)
* **Spoilage Decay Modeling**: Simulates 30-day quality and value degradation across **Open Field**, **Warehouse**, and **Cold Storage** conditions.
* **Haversine Transport Logistics**: Calculates real-world transport costs (₹5/km/quintal) from local farms to 5 regional APMC Mandi markets using coordinate math.
* **Net Return Optimization**: Compares expected net revenue across **Sell Now**, **Store N Days**, and **Transport to Market X**, highlighting the highest financial return option.

### 3. Unified Dashboard & Interactive Visualizations
* **Side-by-Side Evaluation**: View live agronomic advisories and post-harvest financial strategies concurrently in a responsive layout.
* **Recharts Analytics**: Interactive line charts depicting 30-day spoilage decay curves and 90-day APMC market price trends.
* **1-Click Presets**: Pre-populated test scenarios for rapid demonstration across different Gujarat locations and crops.

## Installation & Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
* **Python**: `3.11` or `3.12` (recommended)
* **Node.js**: `18.0` or higher
* **npm**: `9.0` or higher

### 1. Backend Setup

Open a terminal and navigate to the `Backend` directory:

```bash
# Navigate to the Backend directory
cd Backend
