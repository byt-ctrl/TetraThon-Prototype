`# ArgiTech — Precision Crop Advisory & Post-Harvest Planner

An integrated platform for smallholder farmers: personalised crop advisories and post-harvest decision support, built for the ArgiTech pre-screening round.

## Problem

India's 85%+ smallholder farmers lack personalised agronomic advice, and 15–20% of produce is lost post-harvest due to poor storage and market-timing decisions. This prototype addresses both gaps with a single, demoable web application.

## Features

- **Crop Advisory Engine** — Enter location, crop, and sowing date → get 3 ranked advisories (irrigation, fertiliser, pest/disease) with confidence scores and plain-language explanations
- **Post-Harvest Planner** — Enter crop, quantity, storage condition → get Sell / Store / Transport recommendation with expected-return estimate, spoilage curves, and price trends
- **4 crop types** × **5 locations** covered end-to-end
- Mocked weather and market-price data — live API swap without UI changes

## Tech Stack

| Frontend | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS 3 |
| Backend | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite |
