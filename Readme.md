# ArgiTech — Precision Crop Advisory & Post-Harvest Planner

An integrated platform for smallholder farmers: personalised crop advisories and post-harvest decision support, built for the ArgiTech pre-screening round.

## Problem

India's 85%+ smallholder farmers lack personalised agronomic advice, and 15–20% of produce is lost post-harvest due to poor storage and market-timing decisions. This prototype addresses both gaps with a single, demoable web application.

## Features

- **Crop Advisory Engine** — Enter location, crop, and sowing date → get 3 ranked advisories (irrigation, fertiliser, pest/disease) with confidence scores and plain-language explanations
- **Post-Harvest Planner** — Enter crop, quantity, storage condition → get Sell / Store / Transport recommendation with expected-return estimate, spoilage curves, and price trends
- **4 crop types** × **5 locations** covered end-to-end
- Mocked weather and market-price data — live API swap without UI changes

## Tech Stack

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 18+**

All commands run from the `TetraThon-Prototype/` project root.

### Backend

Run these commands from the `Backend/` directory:

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   Using Python 3.11 or 3.12 is highly recommended to ensure pre-compiled binary wheel availability.
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   python -m venv .venv

   # Activate on Windows (CMD or PowerShell):
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # Activate on macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   If your environment lacks C++ build tools or is running a pre-release/experimental version of Python (like Python 3.14), use the fallback command to force-install pre-built binary wheels:
   ```bash
   # Standard installation:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Fallback (resolves linker 'link.exe' or C++ compiler build errors):
   pip install -r requirements.txt --only-binary :all:
   ```

3. **Start the API development server**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn App.main:app --reload --port 8000
   # → Swagger Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

### Frontend

Open a **separate terminal** — keep the backend running.

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

The Vite dev server proxies API calls (`/advisory`, `/locations`, etc.) to `http://localhost:8000` automatically.

### Verify

```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# → {"status":"OK"}

# Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
# Click "Get Crop Advisory" → select crop + location → submit
```
